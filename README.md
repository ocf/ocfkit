# ocfkit

the open computing facility staffer's swiss army knife

## Project Status

Idea Phase: Nothing works! I'm just typing code. Most of these tools are blocked on having a functional API layer somewhere (unless I want to implement them with some SSH hackery).

## Tool Ideas

I don't know how to organize these into the tool...

- restore user public_html directories with one command
- create/delete/start/stop staffVMs or hozers or other VMs
- add/remove someone to/from staff/root
- printing (add/remove paper, print a local or pdf url, take printers in or out of circulation)
- group account creation
- lab apt-dater, lab wakeup
- remote ocf-tv
- jukebox
